        <h3>Perfect Getaway</h3>
        <p>
          On the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to Portsea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of Sorrento that offers restaurants, cafes, a
          chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses from the
          beach. It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and surf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite overlooking a sun
          drenched, tree-filled private garden.
        </p>
        <p>
          A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized
          bedroom and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath entices you to relax and unwind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy! An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty of space to stretch
          out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the perfect place for a home away from home.

      <h3>Pet friendly</h3>
        <p>
          We understand that pets are an important part of the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are pet friendly by arrangement - so please talk to us about your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer a fully enclosed backyard, shady trees, water bowls, food bowls and a lead if you forget one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only 3 minutes from a leash free beach, an oval close by and if you want to sleep in we are happy to take your
          dog (depending on its size) for a walk in the morning.

        <h3>Testimonials</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>"So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time!"</li>
          <li>"This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing"</li>
          <li>"Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive
            back
            to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!"</li>
          <li>"Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt. Thank you."</li>
          <li>"What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely self-contained and very private. We loved it and
            will return again and again."</li>
          <li>"Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever!"</li>
          <li>"A few minutesâ€™ walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel over the shoulder - can't think of
            anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne!"</li>
          <li>Relaxing in that sunny garden watching our dog chasing balls. Let me stay forever!"</li>
